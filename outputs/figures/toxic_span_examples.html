<p>It all took place in a matter of minutes. The moose looks young and didn't look angry until multiple skiers whizzing past him or her, taking video, calling out to one another and generally acting like idiots freaked him or her out.  

It's a damn shame this creature was killed. Makes me ill.</p>

<p>Dumb analogy. Most beaches are watched by lifeguards. "Idiots" entering in conditions way over their heads are warned or rescued. The idiots who enter closed trails and get in way over their heads - most often with the idea to get some "rad photos for the gram" are the ones who put innocent lives in danger. The ocean has preventative options. Hiking on expert only or closed trails do not.</p>

<p>Deplorable liar, hypocrite, demagogue of a militant ideology against the world in wrathful avarice-poisoned pursuit of oil and war profit, paid for in the blood and misery of innocent millions abroad and US domestic enslavement to US$19.978B in wrongful war debt. All on a false presence. The war criminals Cheney and Bush and their collaborators still go at large, still escape the justice of the Hague. It's an affront to civilization itself, and this <mark>c</mark><mark>l</mark><mark>o</mark><mark>w</mark><mark>n</mark><mark>-</mark><mark>b</mark><mark>e</mark><mark>a</mark><mark>s</mark><mark>t</mark> claims to represent the right side of history?</p>

<p>More jealousy of smart college-educated people?  Seems so.  <mark>I</mark><mark>g</mark><mark>n</mark><mark>o</mark><mark>r</mark><mark>a</mark><mark>n</mark><mark>t</mark> people like you, RTHur can't handle complex information.  Seems Allie has you on a short leash.  You can't help but respond with continuing idiocy.  (BTW, do you know how <mark>s</mark><mark>t</mark><mark>u</mark><mark>p</mark><mark>i</mark><mark>d</mark> it looks to add 'lol' to your own post.  Every day you just appear dumber and dumber)</p>

<p>Live by the gun. <mark>D</mark><mark>i</mark><mark>e</mark> by the gun. Same for <mark>s</mark><mark>t</mark><mark>u</mark><mark>p</mark><mark>i</mark><mark>d</mark><mark>i</mark><mark>t</mark><mark>y</mark>. Gonna love the boring retirement life of 6 walls staring at you, schmuck.</p>

<p>the real "problem" is that a bunch of <mark>m</mark><mark>o</mark><mark>r</mark><mark>o</mark><mark>n</mark><mark>s</mark> actually believed that anyone could trust a thing that he says</p>

<p>If Americans had any self-respect Trump would be the object of a ridicule so vicious he wouldn't want to be seen in public anymore. But clearly this won't happen because Trump represents a segment of Americans who are like him: dishonest, creepy, ethically unclean, irredeemably corrupt. If America had some sort of minimum standard for citizenship, these people wouldn't qualify.</p>

<p>You got sucker punched, so clearly all minority grievances are false or exaggerated. Sorry you got punched by some idiot, sorrier that you're using it as an excuse to be a bigot.</p>

<p>Actually, no. Religion is not intended to defend pedophiles, only lunatic pedophiles are the ones attempting to defend themselves.</p>
